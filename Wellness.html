        <h2>Wellness & Health</h2>
        <p> As a college student, it is important to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Below, I will be highlighting a few businesses that promote wellness in multiple functions. </p>

        <p>
            Another black owned gym is “The Well Chicago”. Cycle therapy was founded by Aaron Foster and his wife Aniya Foster. Their combined love for fitness inspired them to create “The Well Chi'' and they brand themselves as more than a gym but as a place that
            is powered by the people it serves to fuel bodies, feed spirits, and fill souls. Like the reciprocal power of water, The Well restores balance facilitating the flow of healing and wellness into oneself and others. We accomplish this through
            high-energy, body-sculpting fitness classes, mental health awareness, and community-building initiatives.
